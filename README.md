# Webmeister
 
Webmeister is a Frontend Web framework aimed to reduce the tedium of normal Javascript development. It uses Typescript and Object Oriented programming to build flexible reusable components.  Webmeister comes built in with event handling and backend communication in a synchronous format. This project was made for Stephen Griders Modern Typescript course.
